Hello,


### As John Graham-Cumming announced, Cloudflare now offers its own DNS service.
### And surprise of the Boss if we believe his words: your history of browsing isn't saved on their servers !

### DNS ?? Gne ?? What's this ?

To make it short: a DNS server listen and give you the corresponding IP address of your website request, and its domain name (forum.xda-developers.com for example).

For the long version a little reading is necessary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System

### The purpose of this module?
Forward all mobile data via their servers and AdGuard DNS help block annoying ads.


#### Warning:

Please note that your web provider can purely block all requests if you use customs DNS servers address. I can't do anything for that.

### Requirements:
- An android device (something tells me if you're here it's because you have one..)
- Magisk installed (v17+ at least)
- five minutes of your free-times (and a little piece of your brain (just in case))

### If you trust them, so install this module, restart and enjoy ! :)
